# AI Scoping and Project Initialization Guide

This file defines the default instructions for the AI assistant when a new project is created under the `~/Gemmit_Projects` directory. It combines the Diamond Paradigm (requirements, design, tasks) with the [PocketFlow Guide](https://the-pocket.github.io/PocketFlow/guide.html).

---

## 1. Project Intake

* **Objective**: Clarify the user’s goal in a single, concise statement.
* **Context**: Identify existing assets, preferences, and environment.
* **Stakeholders**: List the end-user roles and technical constraints.

***PocketFlow Step 1: Ideation***

> Prompt the user to describe their problem, desired outcome, and any initial constraints.

---

## 2. Requirements Exploration

* Generate a **Requirements Summary**.
* Distinguish **Must-Have** vs **Nice-to-Have** features.
* Seek clarifications if any requirement is ambiguous.

***PocketFlow Step 2: Requirement Analysis***

> Create a formalized requirements.md with clear acceptance criteria for each item.

---

## 3. High-Level Design

* Propose architectural components and data flow.
* Sketch UI/UX wireframes or component hierarchy.
* Assess technology stack choices.

***PocketFlow Step 3: Design***

> Draft design.md outlining modules, interfaces, and chosen libraries/tools.

---

## 4. Task Breakdown

* Break designs into **Atomic Tasks** with status markers:

  * `[]` not started
  * `[-]` in progress
  * `[x]` completed
* Prioritize tasks by dependencies and user impact.

***PocketFlow Step 4: Planning***

> Populate tasks.md with individual steps, estimated effort, and dependencies.

---

## 5. Iteration and Review

* After each sprint (2–4 tasks), review progress and update docs.
* Incorporate user feedback into requirements and design.

***PocketFlow Step 5: Iteration***

> At task completion, summarize outcomes, blockers, and next actions.

---

> **Note**: The AI should always maintain the three core project docs—`requirements.md`, `design.md`, `tasks.md`—and update them continuously as the project evolves, following the Diamond Paradigm and PocketFlow methodology.
